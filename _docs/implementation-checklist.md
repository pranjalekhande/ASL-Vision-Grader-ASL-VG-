# ASL Vision Grader - Implementation Checklist

## Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Week 1)

### 1.1 Supabase Setup
- [ ] Create Supabase project
- [ ] Set up authentication (students/teachers)
- [ ] Configure storage buckets
  - `temp/attempts/` (24h retention)
  - `permanent/exemplars/`
  - `landmarks/`
- [ ] Create database tables
  ```sql
  - signs (id, gloss, exemplar_landmarks)
  - attempts (id, student_id, sign_id, scores, heatmap)
  ```

### 1.2 Project Structure
- [ ] Initialize frontend (React)
  - Components structure
  - MediaPipe integration setup
  - Supabase client configuration
- [ ] Set up development environment
  - Dependencies installation
  - Environment variables
  - Build configuration

## Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 2-3)

### 2.1 Video Processing
- [ ] Implement video recording (720p/30FPS)
- [ ] Frame extraction (every 3rd frame)
- [ ] MediaPipe landmark detection
- [ ] Temporary storage handling

### 2.2 Scoring System
- [ ] Implement DTW algorithm
- [ ] Create scoring calculation
  - Handshape accuracy
  - Location accuracy
  - Movement accuracy
- [ ] Generate heat-map data

## Phase 3: User Interface (Weeks 4-5)

### 3.1 Student Features
- [ ] Video recording interface
- [ ] Real-time feedback display
- [ ] Heat-map overlay rendering
- [ ] Attempt history view

### 3.2 Teacher Dashboard
- [ ] Student roster view
- [ ] Performance analytics
- [ ] Attempt review interface
- [ ] Progress tracking

## Phase 4: Integration & Optimization (Weeks 6-7)

### 4.1 Performance
- [ ] Video compression
- [ ] Landmark data optimization
- [ ] Caching implementation
- [ ] Load testing

### 4.2 Security & Monitoring
- [ ] Access control implementation
- [ ] Storage cleanup automation
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Error tracking

## Key Technical Requirements

### Frontend
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.x",
    "mediapipe": "latest",
    "@supabase/supabase-js": "^2.x",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.x"
  }
}
```

### Performance Targets
- Video processing: ≤ 100ms/frame
- Total feedback time: ≤ 3s
- Client memory: ≤ 500MB
- Storage efficiency: 95% reduction via landmark-only storage

## Critical Success Metrics
1. Accurate sign evaluation
2. Real-time feedback (≤ 3s)
3. Efficient storage usage
4. Smooth user experience
5. Reliable performance

## Getting Started
1. Clone repository
2. Set up Supabase project
3. Configure environment variables
4. Install dependencies
5. Start with MediaPipe integration
6. Implement video recording
7. Build scoring system
8. Develop user interface

## Notes
- Focus on MediaPipe integration first (critical path)
- Test performance early and often
- Implement storage cleanup from the start
- Monitor memory usage carefully
- Document as you build
