# Teacher Features Implementation Plan

## 1. Video Review Functionality

### Student Attempt Review
- Display student's recorded video with their attempt scores
- Show scores breakdown (shape, location, movement)
- Video controls: play, pause, speed control, frame-by-frame navigation
- Timeline scrubber for quick navigation

### Side-by-Side Comparison
- Split screen view: student attempt vs exemplar
- Synchronized playback option
- Frame matching based on key poses
- Visual indicators for significant differences

### Hand Landmark Analysis
- Toggle overlay of hand landmarks on both videos
- Color-coded visualization of differences
- Frame-specific landmark data display
- Highlight areas of significant deviation

### Technical Requirements
- Video streaming optimization for smooth playback
- Frame extraction and caching for quick navigation
- WebGL-based landmark visualization
- Synchronized state management for comparison view

## 2. Feedback System

### Text-Based Feedback
- Comment box for general feedback
- Save and track feedback history
- Student notification system for new feedback
- Rich text formatting for better organization

### Timestamp-Based Comments
- Ability to pause video and add comments at specific timestamps
- Timeline markers showing comment locations
- Click-to-jump to commented moments
- Batch comment management

### Feedback Templates
- Pre-defined templates for common corrections
- Custom template creation
- Category-based template organization
- Quick-insert functionality

### Area-Specific Feedback
- Visual marking tools for shape issues
- Location deviation indicators
- Movement path visualization
- Categorized feedback tags

## 3. Analytics & Progress Tracking

### Individual Student Analytics
- Progress graphs over time
- Score breakdown by category
- Attempt frequency tracking
- Improvement rate calculation
- Practice pattern analysis

### Sign-Specific Analytics
- Success rates per sign
- Common mistake patterns
- Difficulty level validation
- Time-to-mastery metrics

### Aggregate Analytics
- Class-wide performance metrics
- Sign difficulty rankings
- Student ranking (optional)
- Progress comparison charts

### Performance Indicators
- Early warning system for struggling students
- Challenging signs identification
- Practice recommendation engine
- Achievement tracking

## Database Schema Updates Required

### Feedback Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE feedback (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    attempt_id UUID REFERENCES attempts(id),
    teacher_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    timestamp_seconds FLOAT,
    category VARCHAR(50),
    area_type VARCHAR(20), -- 'shape', 'location', 'movement'
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Analytics Views
```sql
-- Student progress view
CREATE VIEW student_progress AS
SELECT 
    student_id,
    sign_id,
    AVG(score_shape) as avg_shape,
    AVG(score_location) as avg_location,
    AVG(score_movement) as avg_movement,
    COUNT(*) as attempt_count,
    DATE_TRUNC('week', created_at) as week
FROM attempts
GROUP BY student_id, sign_id, DATE_TRUNC('week', created_at);

-- Sign difficulty view
CREATE VIEW sign_difficulty_metrics AS
SELECT 
    sign_id,
    AVG(score_shape + score_location + score_movement)/3 as avg_score,
    COUNT(DISTINCT student_id) as student_count,
    COUNT(*) as total_attempts
FROM attempts
GROUP BY sign_id;
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Video Review
1. Implement video player with controls
2. Add landmark visualization
3. Create side-by-side comparison view
4. Implement basic feedback system

### Phase 2: Advanced Feedback
1. Add timestamp-based comments
2. Implement feedback templates
3. Create area-specific feedback tools
4. Add feedback notifications

### Phase 3: Analytics
1. Implement individual progress tracking
2. Add sign-specific analytics
3. Create aggregate views
4. Build performance indicators

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Video streaming optimization
- Landmark data compression
- Caching strategy for frequently accessed data
- Lazy loading for analytics

### Security
