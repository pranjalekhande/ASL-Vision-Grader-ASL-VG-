# Testing Student Features in Teacher Dashboard

## Current Status
The teacher dashboard is fully implemented with real student data integration. However, the database currently contains no student accounts, which is why you see "0 Active Students".

## How to Test Student Features

### Method 1: Create a Real Student Account

1. **Sign out** from your current teacher account
2. **Create a new account** at the login page
3. **Update the role** in the database:
   ```sql
   UPDATE profiles 
   SET role = 'student' 
   WHERE id = 'your-new-user-id';
   ```

### Method 2: Modify Existing Account Temporarily

1. **Update your current account** to student role:
   ```sql
   UPDATE profiles 
   SET role = 'student' 
   WHERE id = 'your-current-user-id';
   ```
2. **Access student dashboard** and record practice attempts
3. **Switch back to teacher role**:
   ```sql
   UPDATE profiles 
   SET role = 'teacher' 
   WHERE id = 'your-current-user-id';
   ```

### Method 3: Use Database Console

1. **Insert test student data** directly:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO profiles (id, full_name, role, institution, created_at)
   VALUES (
     gen_random_uuid(),
     'Test Student',
     'student',
     'Test University',
     NOW()
   );
   ```

## What Will Be Visible in Teacher Dashboard

Once student accounts exist and have recorded attempts, you'll see:

### ✅ Overview Tab
- **Active Students count** (instead of 0)
- **Average class score** (calculated from real attempts)
- **Recent Activity** with student names and attempt counts

### ✅ Student Progress Tab
- **Complete student table** with:
  - Student names and institutions
  - Total attempts per student
  - Average scores with color coding
  - Join dates
  - "View Details" buttons

### ✅ Student Detail Modal
When clicking "View Details":
- **Student statistics** (total attempts, average score, high scores)
- **Recent attempts list** with:
  - Sign names and timestamps
  - Individual score breakdowns (Shape, Location, Movement)
  - Color-coded overall scores

### ✅ Real Data Features
- **Live attempt counting** from database
- **Real score calculations** from DTW algorithm
- **Actual student metadata** (names, institutions, join dates)
- **Recent attempts** with full score breakdowns

## Current Implementation Features

All the features you requested are fully implemented:

1. ✅ **Real student data instead of mock data**
   - Queries `profiles` table for role='student'
   - Loads actual attempt statistics from `attempts` table

2. ✅ **Student attempt statistics** 
   - Calculates total attempts per student
   - Computes average scores from real DTW results
   - Counts high-performing attempts (80%+)

3. ✅ **Detailed student modal**
   - Shows comprehensive student stats
   - Lists recent attempts with full details
   - Displays score breakdowns by category

4. ✅ **Clickable student rows**
   - "View Details" button on each student
   - Opens modal with full student information

5. ✅ **Recent attempts display**
   - Individual score breakdowns (Shape/Location/Movement)
   - Color-coded performance indicators
   - Timestamps and sign names

## Console Debugging

The teacher dashboard now includes console logging to help debug:

- `All profiles in database:` - Shows all user accounts and their roles
- `Raw students data from query:` - Shows students found with role='student'
- `Students with stats calculated:` - Shows final student data with attempt statistics

Check the browser console when loading the teacher dashboard to see what data exists.

## Next Steps

To see the student features in action:
1. Create at least one student account
2. Have the student record some practice attempts
3. Return to teacher dashboard to see the data populate

The system is ready - it just needs student data to display!
