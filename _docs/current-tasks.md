## Getting Started Context

For the next prompt, you should focus on the DTW implementation:

1. Start with `src/utils/dtw.ts`:
   - Implement core DTW algorithm
   - Add distance calculations
   - Create scoring functions

2. Then create `src/hooks/useComparison.ts`:
   - Manage comparison state
   - Handle landmark alignment
   - Calculate scores

3. Finally, add `src/components/comparison/ScoreDisplay.tsx`:
   - Show comparison results
   - Visualize differences
   - Display scores

This will set up the foundation for comparing student attempts with reference signs.
