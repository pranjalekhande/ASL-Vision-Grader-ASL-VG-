"""
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) implementation for comparing landmark sequences
"""

# DTW algorithm will be implemented here
"""
Key Functions:
1. calculate_distance: Compare two landmark vectors
2. dtw_score: Calculate DTW distance between sequences
3. generate_heatmap: Create frame-by-frame difference visualization
